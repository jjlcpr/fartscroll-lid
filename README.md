# FartScrollLid ðŸ’¨

A hilarious macOS app that plays fart sounds as you open and close your MacBook lid - inspired by the classic "fart scroll" browser extension!

## Features

- ðŸŽµ **Dynamic Fart Sounds** - Pitch changes based on lid angle (deep bass when closed, high squeaks when open)
- ðŸŽ¯ **Motion-Activated** - Only farts when you're actively moving the lid
- ðŸ“Š **Real-Time Monitoring** - Shows lid angle, velocity, and fart parameters
- ðŸ˜„ **Funny Status Messages** - "Maximum pressure!", "Gas escaping!", and more

## How It Works

FartScrollLid uses the MacBook's internal lid angle sensor (discovered through reverse engineering) to detect the angle between your laptop lid and base. When you move the lid, it triggers fart sounds with:

- **Pitch modulation** based on lid angle (0-130 degrees)
- **Volume control** based on movement speed
- **Instant response** - farts stop immediately when you stop moving

## Requirements

- macOS 11.5 or later
- MacBook with lid angle sensor (most modern MacBooks)
- A sense of humor

## Installation

### Option 1: Build from Source

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/iannuttall/fartscroll-lid.git
cd fartscroll-lid
```

2. Open in Xcode:
```bash
open FartScrollLid.xcodeproj
```

3. Build and run (Cmd+R)

### Option 2: Download Release

Download the latest `.app` from the [Releases](https://github.com/yourusername/fartscroll-lid/releases) page.

## Usage

1. Launch FartScrollLid
2. Click "Start Farting"
3. Move your MacBook lid up and down
4. Enjoy the symphony of farts!
5. Stop moving to silence the farts
6. Click "Stop Farting" when you've had enough fun

## Technical Details

### Lid Angle Sensor
- **Device**: Apple HID device (VID=0x05AC, PID=0x8104)
- **HID Usage**: Sensor page (0x0020), Orientation usage (0x008A)
- **Data format**: 16-bit angle value in centidegrees (0.01Â° resolution)
- **Range**: 0-360 degrees

### Audio Engine
- Uses AVFoundation for real-time audio playback
- Varispeed unit for pitch modulation (0.5x to 2.0x)
- Smooth parameter ramping to avoid audio artifacts
- Movement threshold: 2 deg/s minimum to trigger farts
